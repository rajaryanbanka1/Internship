       " 'About the role A Data Scientist in Flipkart is required to develop and implement a mix of ML, statistical and optimization models for the various projects formulated from business and product views. The responsible person should be able to communicate and collaborate with multiple stakeholders representing various teams to better understand the problem at hand. At a fundamental level, the responsible person should be able to dive deep into a problem statement and extract interesting insights as well as solutions. In addition to being a quick learner, a DS is expected to get involved in active research projects with a view to publish them. What you ll do Understand Business and product needs and use ML, statistical and optimization techniques as appropriate to provide solutions to those in a time bound fashion. Communicate and collaborate with business and product teams to have a better understanding of the project so as to be able to drive it within the DS team. Get involved in in-depth exploration of solutions that are to be shared with business and product teams; specifically, build models and scalable custom algorithms for problems including decision optimization and predictive modeling. Active participation in working with new methods and learning new technologies, in areas including data science and data engineering. What you ll need: B.Tech, M.Tech or PhD in CS, Operations Research or related discipline with professional experience ranging from 3 to 6 years through deployed solutions/projects. Candidate should have taken academic coursework in Operations Research (specifically mathematical optimization) Demonstrated experience in building discrete, linear, nonlinear or stochastic optimization models is required. Experience with optimization models for supply chain optimization is preferred but not required Demonstrated experience in utilizing and tuning commercial optimization solvers (e.g. CPLEX, Gurobi) and in building custom optimization algorithms (e.g. exact algorithms, metaheuristics, large neighborhood search, decomposition algorithms, greedy/randomized search) for industry-scale problems is required.

The responsible person should be able to communicate and collaborate with multiple stakeholders representing various teams to better understand the problem at hand. At a fundamental level, the responsible person should be able to dive deep into a problem statement and extract interesting insights as well as solutions. In addition to being a quick learner, a DS is expected to get involved in active research projects with a view to publish them. What you ll do Understand Business and product needs and use ML, statistical and optimization techniques as appropriate to provide solutions to those in a time bound fashion. Communicate and collaborate with business and product teams to have a better understanding of the project so as to be able to drive it within the DS team. Get involved in in-depth exploration of solutions that are to be shared with business and product teams; specifically, build models and scalable custom algorithms for problems including decision optimization and predictive modeling. Active participation in working with new methods and learning new technologies, in areas including data science and data engineering. What you ll need: B.Tech, M.Tech or PhD in CS, Operations Research or related discipline with professional experience ranging from 3 to 6 years through deployed solutions/projects. Candidate should have taken academic coursework in Operations Research (specifically mathematical optimization) Demonstrated experience in building discrete, linear, nonlinear or stochastic optimization models is required. Experience with optimization models for supply chain optimization is preferred but not required Demonstrated experience in utilizing and tuning commercial optimization solvers (e.g. CPLEX, Gurobi) and in building custom optimization algorithms (e.g. exact algorithms, metaheuristics, large neighborhood search, decomposition algorithms, greedy/randomized search) for industry-scale problems is required. Good grasp on the theory and practise of basic statistical models such as regression or clustering and general ML algorithms such as tree, Random Forests, SVM, Boosting, Neural Networks etc. It is not expected that the candidate has actually worked on all these modules. Strong proficiency in Python or R is necessary.  \n",
